# **AI Infrastructure Engineering Journey 2026**
*A structured, certificate‑driven roadmap documenting my transition from Senior DevOps Engineer to AI Infrastructure Engineer by March 15, 2026.*

Over the last 13 years, I’ve built my career around **DevOps engineering, cloud automation, and the Microsoft ecosystem**, with deep experience in:

- .NET application development  
- CI/CD pipelines and release automation  
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes, WSL2)  
- Infrastructure‑as‑Code  
- Cross‑platform systems engineering  
- Designing reproducible, scalable environments for experimentation and deployment  

In 2025, I expanded my work into **GPU‑based model workflows**, including MusicGen, AudioCraft, Ace‑Step, and multimodal systems inside containerized environments. That experience clarified something important: **AI engineering is the natural next step in my career**.

2026 is the year I formalize that transition.

This repository documents my **90‑day transformation** into a production‑ready **AI Infrastructure Engineer**, with a focus on the highest‑value skills in the industry:

- Distributed training (DDP, FSDP, DeepSpeed)  
- Model optimization (ONNX, TensorRT, quantization)  
- GPU‑aware orchestration (Kubernetes + NVIDIA stack)  
- MLOps pipelines and model registries  
- Multimodal systems (audio, video, text)  
- End‑to‑end AI platform engineering  

The goal is to be fully interview‑ready for top‑tier AI engineering roles by **March 15, 2026**.

## **📑 Roadmap Overview**
This journey is broken into eight phases:

1. **Setup**  
2. **ML Foundations**  
3. **Distributed Training**  
4. **Model Optimization**  
5. **AI Infrastructure**  
6. **Flagship Project**  
7. **Multimodal Specialization**  
8. **Interview Prep & Application Sprint**

Each phase includes:
- Daily tasks  
- Certificate‑granting courses  
- Benchmarks  
- Code deliverables  
- Documentation

## **🎯 Goal**
By March 15, 2026, I will be fully prepared to interview for:

- **AI Infrastructure Engineer**  
- **Senior MLOps Engineer**  
- **AI Platform Engineer**  
- **Multimodal Systems Engineer**

These roles represent the highest‑impact, highest‑compensation segment of the AI engineering field, and align directly with my background in DevOps, automation, and GPU‑accelerated workflows.
